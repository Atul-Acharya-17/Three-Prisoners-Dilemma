	 This Java program models the two-player Prisoner's Dilemma game.
	 We use the integer "0" to represent cooperation, and "1" to represent 
	 defection. 
	 
	 Recall that in the 2-players dilemma, U(DC) > U(CC) > U(DD) > U(CD), where
	 we give the payoff for the first player in the list. We want the three-player game 
	 to resemble the 2-player game whenever one player's response is fixed, and we
	 also want symmetry, so U(CCD) = U(CDC) etc. This gives the unique ordering
	 
	 U(DCC) > U(CCC) > U(DDC) > U(CDC) > U(DDD) > U(CDD)
	 
	 The payoffs for player 1 are given by the following matrix: */

	     {5,2}}};//payoffs when first and second players defect
	
	/* 
	 So payoff[i][j][k] represents the payoff to player 1 when the first
	 player's action is i, the second player's action is j, and the
	 third player's action is k.
	 
	 In this simulation, triples of players will play each other repeatedly in a
	 'match'. A match consists of about 100 rounds, and your score from that match
	 is the average of the payoffs from each round of that match. For each round, your
	 strategy is given a list of the previous plays (so you can remember what your 
	 opponent did) and must compute the next action.  */
